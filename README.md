# WHAT IS LZRBIT?

LZRBIT is a drawing-app designed to create web-art using the BBC Microbit microcontroller.

Pieces of Art are created by using the microbit accelerometer BLE service - Bluetooth Low Energy- paired with the browser.

## How to use the LZRBIT?

1.To use this Application you will need a microbit and the Chrome Browser.

First you need to download and [upload this firmware](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B2Ud_NaMFsQSdm1BMVMtN3F4a3c&export=download) on your BBC micro:bit board.

*The firmware was produced by bittysoftware.com*

2.Keep in mind that web bluetooth API are still experimental and your OS and browser might not support the feature.

Use Google Chrome as the Browser - BLE API - to make sure it will work.

3.Once the firmware is uploaded to your microbit and you are using the Chrome Browser:

Go to the LZRBIT APP section
Use the PAIR BUTTON to pair your microbit accelerometer witht the LZRBIT App.

**. Use the microbit x,y,z axis to draw on the canvas by rotating them**

**. Open the top right 'OPEN CONTROLS' Tab to have access to size and color control**

**. Press the Line checkbox to draw lines.**

**. Press the Point checkbox to draw points.**

**. Uncheck both to reset.**

**. You can hide/show the 'Controls' by pressing 'h'**

**. Draw your design with patience and love.**

**. Save your design by clicking the 'SAVE' button on the APP.**

## Future versions

In future versions we want to add other sensors to drive the drawing app, like:

1.Mobile Telephon Gyroscope Connection ( 2 Apps connected in Realtime )

2 NextMind API - A non invasive human brain interface (...)
