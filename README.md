# WHAT IS LZRBIT?

LZRBIT is a drawing-app designed to create web-art using the BBC Microbit microcontroller.

Pieces of Art are created by using the microbit accelerometer BLE service - Bluetooth Low Energy- paired with the browser.

## How to use the LZRBIT?

**1. Use ONLY with Google Chrome.**

**2. Download this .hex file to your Microbit.**

**3. Use the PAIR MICROBIT button for pairing devices.**

**4. The microbit ‘flat’ on one of both hands aligns to (x=0, y=0).**

**5. Use the CONTROLS PANEL at the top of the canvas to modify variables.**

**6. Press the POINT checkbox to draw points, and adjust its parameters.**

**7. Press the LINE checkbox to draw lines, and adjust its parameters.**

**8. Use the microbit x,y,z axis to draw on the canvas by rotating them.**

**9. Use the ‘SAVE’ button to save your design.**

**10. Uncheck both, POINT and LINE, to reset the screen to the starting position.**

## Future versions

In future versions we want to add other sensors to drive the drawing app, like:

1.Mobile Telephon Gyroscope Connection ( 2 Apps connected in Realtime )

2 NextMind API - A non invasive human brain interface (...)
